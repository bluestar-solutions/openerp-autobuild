Description: openerp-autobuild is a script to automatically run openerp
Inspired by solutions like composer (http://getcomposer.org) this tool is made for OpenERP modules developers. 
It manages the dependencies and the run goal of your project. By enabling the possibility to define precisely the revision of 
OpenERP you want to use in your project and by managing your custom dependencies and their transitive dependencies, 
it improves teams collaboration on projects ensuring developments and test are made on the same defined version.
